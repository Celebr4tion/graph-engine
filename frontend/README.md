# Graph Engine Frontend

This is a minimal frontend for visualizing the dependency graph generated by the Graph Engine.

## Requirements

* Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* Running Graph Engine API server

## Features

* Interactive graph visualization using Cytoscape.js
* Node styling based on type (function, module, class, etc.)
* Edge styling based on relationship (calls, imports, etc.)
* Dynamic sizing based on call counts
* Interactive features:
  * Zoom in/out using mouse wheel
  * Pan by dragging
  * Node/edge tooltips on hover
  * Double-click to fit graph to viewport

## Setup Instructions

1. Start the API server:
   ```
   python run_api_server.py
   ```

2. Open the frontend in a web browser:
   * If using the API server's built-in static file serving, navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:8000/frontend/
     ```
   * Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser:
     ```
     file:///path/to/graph-engine/frontend/index.html
     ```
     (Note: When opening directly, you'll need to ensure CORS is properly configured in the API server)

3. The graph should load automatically and display the nodes and edges.

## Troubleshooting

* If the graph doesn't load, check the browser console for errors.
* Ensure the API server is running and accessible.
* If using the file:// protocol, you may need to configure your browser to allow cross-origin requests.
* For larger graphs, the layout algorithm may take some time to complete - please be patient.

## Development

To modify the frontend:

1. Edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed.
2. Refresh the browser to see your changes.

No build step is required for this minimal implementation.
