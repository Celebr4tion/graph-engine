Frontend Tests

This module provides test cases and examples for the frontend visualization.
Since frontend testing typically requires different tooling (browser automation, etc.),
this file serves primarily as documentation and manual test instructions.

        Frontend Test Instructions
        =========================
        
        Prerequisites:
        -------------
        1. Python environment with FastAPI and Uvicorn installed
        2. Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
        
        Steps to Test:
        -------------
        1. Start the API server:
           $ python run_api_server.py
           
           This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default
        
        2. Open the frontend:
           - Using a direct file path:
             file:///{frontend_path}/index.html
             
           - Or using a simple HTTP server:
             $ cd {project_root}
             $ python -m http.server
             Then navigate to: http://localhost:8000/frontend/
        
        3. Verify the following functionality:
           - Graph loads and displays nodes and edges
           - Nodes are colored by type
           - Edges show direction with arrows
           - You can zoom in/out using the mouse wheel
           - You can pan by clicking and dragging
           - Hovering over nodes shows tooltips with details
           - Double-clicking fits the graph to the viewport
        
        4. If the graph doesn't load:
           - Check the browser console for errors
           - Ensure the API server is running
           - Verify that the API endpoints return data:
             - http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/nodes
             - http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/edges
