Frontend Tests

This module provides test cases and examples for the frontend visualization.
Since frontend testing typically requires different tooling (browser automation, etc.),
this file serves primarily as documentation and manual test instructions.

        Frontend Test Instructions
        =========================
        
        Prerequisites:
        -------------
        1. Python environment with FastAPI and Uvicorn installed
        2. Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
        
        Steps to Test:
        -------------
        1. Start the API server:
           $ python run_api_server.py
           
           This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default
        
        2. Open the frontend:
           - Using a direct file path:
             file:///{frontend_path}/index.html
             
           - Or using a simple HTTP server:
             $ cd {project_root}
             $ python -m http.server
             Then navigate to: http://localhost:8000/frontend/
        
        3. Verify the basic functionality:
           - Graph loads and displays nodes and edges
           - Nodes are colored by type
           - Edges show direction with arrows
           - You can zoom in/out using the mouse wheel
           - You can pan by clicking and dragging
           - Hovering over nodes shows tooltips with details
           - Double-clicking fits the graph to the viewport
        
        4. Test the new filtering functionality:
           - Use the Node Types checkboxes to filter nodes by type
             (e.g., uncheck "Modules" to hide all module nodes)
           - Use the Edge Types checkboxes to filter edges by type
             (e.g., uncheck "Imports" to hide all import edges)
           - Toggle "Show Dynamic Edges" to show/hide dynamic call edges
           - Toggle "Highlight Call Counts" to highlight nodes/edges with call counts
        
        5. Test the node details panel:
           - Click on a node to display detailed information in a side panel
           - Verify that the panel shows the node's ID, type, name, and other properties
           - Check that clicking the close button (Ã—) hides the panel
           - Verify that clicking on a node also highlights its connections
        
        6. Test the layout controls:
           - Click "Re-layout Graph" to re-organize the graph layout
           - Click "Fit to View" to fit all nodes within the viewport
        
        7. If the graph doesn't load:
           - Check the browser console for errors
           - Ensure the API server is running
           - Verify that the API endpoints return data:
             - http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/nodes
             - http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/edges
